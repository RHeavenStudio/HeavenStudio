## Prebuilt Binaries & Downloads
This project is still in development, so there are currently no release builds yet. GitHub Actions creates experimental builds on each commmit, but minimal support will be provided.

### Release 1 alpha builds
These builds do not include some of the features from Nightly, instead focusing on stability. These builds will eventually culminate in the first stable release of Heaven Studio.
- [Windows](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/release_1/StandaloneWindows64-build.zip)
- [Linux](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/release_1/StandaloneLinux64-build.zip)
- [MacOS](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/release_1/StandaloneOSX-build.zip)

### Nightly builds
These builds include experimental new features that may or may not be included in Release 1
- [Windows](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneWindows64-build.zip)
- [Linux](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneLinux64-build.zip)
- [MacOS](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneOSX-build.zip)


#### Important Notes:
- MP3 audio with variable bitrate encoding may [desync when seeking in the editor](https://github.com/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/issues/490). Either use MP3s with constant bitrate encoding or use one of our other supported formats (OGG Vorbis, WAV...)
- On MacOS and Linux builds you may [experience bugs with audio-related tasks](https://github.com/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/issues/72), but in most cases Heaven Studio works perfectly.
- On MacOS you'll need to have Discord open in the background for now, there's a bug that causes the DiscordSDK library to crash when the rich presence is updated while Discord is not open in the background.
