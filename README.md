## I sent it again
Currently, there is not much construction work in the project. GitHub controls everything, but it doesn't allow it.


- [Window:](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/windows/master/StandaloneWindows64-build.zip)
- [Linux:](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/linux/master/StandaloneLinux64-build.zip)
- [Apple software](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/macos/master/StandaloneOSX-build.zip)
#### The real problem is:
- It's hard on [MacOS and Linux](https://github.com/megaminerjenny/HeavenStudio/issues/72), but RYthm cinema Studio is great.
- On macOS, Discord can open in the background, but the DiscordSDK does not open in the background and Discord crashes.
- Use the instructions below for MacOS and Linux binaries (**except Satimo** and other small games).


## Self-Building

RYthm cinema Studio is based on [Unity 2020.3.21](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.21),
and [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
